You can use this directly via the MapboxNavigation class or through the Navigation UI SDK.Built on top of the core Navigation SDK (meaning the Navigation SDK is included when you add the Navigation UI SDK as a dependency), the Navigation UI SDK consumes data from the core SDK and arranges it in default UI components that have various customization options. You can use this directly via the NavigationView and NavigationLauncher classes without touching the core MapboxNavigation class directly in your application's code.The core Navigation SDK and the Navigation UI SDK can be used together if you want to use a mixture of the Mapbox-provided UI components and your own custom UI fed data from the core Navigation SDK.\n",

You'll need to include either the fine or coarse location permission for navigation to work properly. The user location permission should also be checked during runtime using the PermissionsManager if your app targets the Android API 23 or higher.For optimal navigation results, use the fine location permission, which gives a more precise fix on the user's current location.<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION\" />\n",
